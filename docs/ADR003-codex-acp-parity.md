# ADR003: Muse Code ACP feature parity with Codex ACP

- **Date:** 2026-09-12
- **Status:** Accepted as the parity tracking approach; feature delivery remains per row.
- **Scope:** User-visible ACP behavior, extensions, host integration, and distribution.
- **Muse source snapshot:** `3b268916e294621de845e858ae528aac8373ff28` plus the local work board inspected on this date; package version `0.2.0`.
- **Codex reference snapshot:** `.tmp/codex-acp` at `effb0fe670a49dfbb5071764b5f8a2e3c09e2393`; package version `1.11.0`.

## Context

Muse Code ACP adapts Muse's public SDK/MSP and an explicit legacy exec backend to
ACP. Codex ACP provides a useful reference for editor integration, runtime
visibility, session control, and negotiated extensions. Equivalent provider
capabilities do not automatically produce equivalent ACP behavior: an adapter
must translate, advertise, and validate them.

This document consolidates both source comparisons and their w1 handoffs. It is
a repository implementation snapshot, not a claim about the latest npm release
or a promise that every feature works on every provider or editor. In particular,
the old w1 queues have been split into current w2 delivery and future native
watches. The [dated capability audit](capability-audit.md) supersedes blanket
worker/compaction blockers: 1.2.1 workflow launch succeeds, while durable
compaction rejects on both tested hosts and does not block usage reporting.
Earlier statements that models are static or every SDK turn spawns a new host
no longer describe the current implementation.

## Decision

Track parity by observable behavior and protocol contract, using Codex ACP as a
reference rather than copying provider-specific internals. Prefer standard ACP
fields; document and negotiate extensions where needed. Preserve useful baseline
behavior for clients that do not support an extension.

Public SDK declarations are investigation leads, not proof of host support.
Advertise only implemented behavior supported by the selected backend. Preserve
Muse's sandbox defaults and real host-offered permission choices; never implement
parity by automating the TUI, inventing MSP methods, or replaying an ambiguous turn
through another backend. See [anti-goals](../.pm/DO_NOT_DO.md).

### Reading the matrices

- **Supported:** Implemented for the stated scope; not necessarily identical wire semantics.
- **Partial:** Some behavior exists, with material differences described in the row.
- **Missing:** No corresponding adapter feature; a plan or SDK type does not count.
- **Blocked:** Required host behavior has a recorded failure preventing delivery.
- **Not advertised:** Deliberately absent from the capability contract.

Muse status refers to the default SDK backend unless the row says otherwise.
Codex entries describe the inspected reference checkout, including its experimental
extensions. “Negotiated” does not mean a standard ACP feature or universal client
support. Workstream references identify scheduled scope, not delivery evidence.

Muse steering requires `clientCapabilities._meta["muse/steering"] = 1` and uses
`_muse/steer` with `expectedTurnId`. Acceptance is admission, not completion or a
guarantee that another provider call will occur. A compatible host expires after
60 seconds idle or rotates after 32 successful turns. Configuration, credentials,
workspace, mode, or MCP changes can require replacement. See
[host lifecycle and steering](sdk-migration.md#session-owned-hosts-and-steering),
[steering protocol](../src/steering-protocol.ts),
[session store](../src/session-store.ts), and [elicitation](../src/muse-user-input.ts).

### Recorded durable-compaction blocker

The [m9 validation record](../.pm/w1/evidence/2026-09-14-superseded/m9.md) reports two
isolated loopback reproductions on Muse Code `1.1.1-R2514.1`, SDK `0.1.1`, macOS.
After a completed durable turn, public `session/compact` returned MSP `-32030`
with `compaction_unavailable`, including with experimental API negotiation.
This is admission rejection, not accepted compaction, successful noop, or a
completed lifecycle. The same investigation observed a raw token-usage event.

Thus usage is an adapter gap while durable compaction has observed host failure.
Do not generalize this into a claim about every Muse build. A newer supported
host must be tested before updating the row; schema presence and fake-host
success do not resolve this blocker. Fresh m6 probes reproduce the same rejection
on 1.2.1. Native compaction is now w1/004; current usage/output delivery is w2/m7
and has no dependency on that watch.

## Delivery map

The [w1 board](../.pm/w1/README.md) owns task status and dependencies. These labels
are a dated summary; update links if open milestones are archived.

| Milestone | Scope                                                                      | Snapshot status                                                      |

| m19       | Public/paginated session discovery, history and live metadata              | Delivered: public pages, observed metadata, complete export fallback |

Rows explicitly marked without a dedicated task are documented gaps, not new
commitments. This ADR does not silently expand milestones to include all Codex
features, mandate provider-specific functionality, or change board dependencies.

## Consequences and maintenance

- Parity is assessed per surface; avoid a single percentage that treats a custom
  extension, partial mapping, and a verified standard feature as interchangeable.
- Preserve distinctions between input images and output artifacts, plans and plan
  mode, worker sessions and background commands, close and delete, and token usage
  and account quota.
- On delivery, update the relevant row with source/test evidence and host/backend
  limits. A checked board item alone is insufficient when source behavior differs.
- Keep [SDK compatibility](sdk-migration.md) and this inventory consistent. Resolve
  stale prose against implementation plus recorded verification, not by repeating
  old README claims.
- Local `.tmp/codex-acp` links are inspection references and may be absent from an
  installed package. The recorded commit pins the comparison; repository-owned
  source, docs and work items preserve the conclusions independently.
- This documentation change does not run new host acceptance tests. Existing
  evidence is cited above; unverified provider/host surfaces remain explicitly so.
